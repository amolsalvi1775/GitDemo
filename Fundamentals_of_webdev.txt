Fundamental of WEB DEV idk what to expect from ts

MERN :

>> M: MongoDB (Database) : store our data persistently over here
>> E: Expressjs (Backend) : In order to build server
>> A/R: Angularjs/Reactjs (Frontend) : Loooks
>> N: Nodejs (Backend)


3 building blocks/pillars:

>>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) : raw contents on the screen
static application : wont be having any dynamic action 
>>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), Bootstrap, Tailwind : styling

>>JS (Java Script)
used for dynamic actions
brain/heart of the webpage : logical

Other Stacks : Mern, Mean, Java Full Stack, Python Full Stack


with all 3 we can build dynamic websites


Web dev :
>> Building/Developers Team : restricted to code and get the functionality shit ON 
can also do certain amount of system testing as well
Or unit testing

>> Testing Team : Manual/Automated Testers
Cross check everything 
in case of any breakage or loopholes the dev team is sent back to fix that
Once the website is error free the control is shifted on to the Hosting Team

>>Hosting Team : Devops team
make sure that the web application in available on the client side machine as well

>>Maintenance Team/Support Team : 
takes feedback
gives instruction to the people who dont know how to use


SDLC : Software Development Life Cycle >> Basically the approach in which the above teams interact with each other
>> Waterfall Model : 
Definition: A linear and sequential development model.

Phases: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.

Key Features:

Each phase must be completed before the next begins.

No going back once a phase is finished.

Best For: Projects with well-defined requirements and minimal change.

>> Agile Model :

Definition: An iterative and incremental model focusing on flexibility and customer collaboration.

Key Features:

Development is divided into sprints (typically 2-4 weeks).

Continuous feedback, testing, and improvement.

Emphasizes working software over documentation.

Best For: Projects with changing requirements and need for quick delivery.


>> Spiral Model : 

Definition: A risk-driven model combining iterative development and systematic risk analysis.

Phases per cycle: Planning → Risk Analysis → Engineering → Evaluation.

Key Features:

Development goes through repeated spirals, refining the product each time.

Focuses on risk management.

Best For: Large, complex, and high-risk projects.

>> Iterative Model :

Definition: A model where software is developed in iterations, each adding improvements.

Key Features:

Initial version is created, then improved in repeated cycles.

Feedback is gathered after each iteration.

Best For: Projects that need progressive refinement.

>> Incremental Model :

Definition: The product is built and delivered in small functional parts (increments).

Key Features:

Each increment adds a working feature.

Earlier increments are tested and used while others are developed.

Best For: Projects needing early partial delivery of the product.

>> V shaped Model :

Definition: An extension of the Waterfall model with testing at each development stage.

Key Features:

Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase.

Emphasizes verification and validation.

Best For: Projects where testing is a priority and requirements are fixed.

>> RAD Rapid Application Development Model :

Definition: A model focused on quick development using prototypes and user feedback.

Key Features:

Uses reusable components and time-boxed development.

Emphasizes user involvement.

Best For: Projects that need rapid delivery and can involve frequent user interaction.
